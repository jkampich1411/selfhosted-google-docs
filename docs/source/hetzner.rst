Costs Breakdown
---------------
In the short-term, this is the cheapest option. If you leave this running for long, costs add up though. If you want a long-term cheaper solution, check out (:doc:`raspberrypi`).

For Hetzner, you need to pay every month, for a Server and a Storage Box. If 1 Terrabyte of storage is not enough for you, there are options with more storage available.
